# Design of Experiments

> The design of any task that aims to describe or explain a varation of information 
under conditions that are hypothesized to reflect that variation.

An experiment aims to predict an outcome by introducing a change in preconditions, reflected by a (predictor). A predictor is usually hypothesized to result in a change in the (outcome) variable. Experiments should choose suitable predictors, outcomes, and plan to deliver
the experiment under optimal conditions given constraints of avaiable resources.
