# Design of Experiments

> The design of any task that aims to describe or explain a varation of information 
under conditions that are hypothesized to reflect that variation.

An experiment aims to predict an outcome by introducing a change in preconditions, reflected by a (predictor). A predictor is usually hypothesized to result in a change in the (outcome) variable. Experiments should choose suitable predictors, outcomes, and plan to deliver
the experiment under optimal conditions given constraints of avaiable resources.

#### Concerns in include:
- Establishment of validity
- Reliability
- Replicability
- Statistical Power and Sensitivity

> *Correctly designed experiments advance knowledge in the natural and social sciences and engineering.*

#### Example:

A surgeon is looking to find a remedy for a disease, so he chooses to carry out a clinical trial in a systematic way using DOE. The surgeon *selects* 12 men all suffering from the same (*similarity*) disease using a strict set of entry *requirements*. He then divided them into 6 pairs and gave each of them a *different* supplement for a set amount of *time*. Finally, he *measured* the effect of each test subject and collected *data* to analyze using statistical analysis.
