# Process Capability

> Process capability is a measurable property of a process to the specification. 
The output is usually illustrated by a histogram and calculations that predict how many parts will be produced out of specification.

#### Parts of Process Capability

1. Measure the variability of the output of a process
2. Compare the variability with a proposed specification

#### Measuring the process

The input of a process can be analyzed statistically with process characteristics where the output data shows a normal distribution
the process can be described by the process mean and the standard deviation.
